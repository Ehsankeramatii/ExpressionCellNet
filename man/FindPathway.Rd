\title{Find the shortest path between two genes in the network}
\usage{
FindPathway(ExpCellNetObj, Start_gene, End_gene)
}
\arguments{
\item{ExpCellNetObj}{An ExpressionCellNet object containing a constructed network.}

\item{Start_gene}{Character; source gene symbol (must exist as a node in the network).}

\item{End_gene}{Character; destination gene symbol (must exist as a node in the network).}
}
\value{
A character vector of gene symbols representing the shortest path.
}
\description{
Computes the shortest interaction path (as a sequence of gene names) between a
start gene and an end gene using the network stored in the ExpressionCellNet object.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
obj <- BuildNetwork(obj, Gene="PYGO2", Generation=3, CorrelationThreshold=c(0.7,0.7,0.7))
path <- FindPathway(obj, Start_gene="PYGO2", End_gene="ATAD5")
path
}
