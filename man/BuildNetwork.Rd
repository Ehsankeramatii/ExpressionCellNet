\title{Construct a gene interaction network centered on a seed gene}
\usage{
BuildNetwork(
  ExpCellNetObj,
  Gene = "PYGO2",
  Generation = 3,
  CorrelationThreshold = c(0.7, 0.7, 0.7)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ExpCellNetObj}{An ExpressionCellNet object containing expression and interaction data.}

\item{Gene}{Character; seed gene name (generation 0).}

\item{Generation}{Integer; number of generations to expand from the seed gene.}

\item{CorrelationThreshold}{Numeric vector; per-generation correlation thresholds.}
}
\value{
Updated ExpressionCellNet object with added components such as "Network" and "Generations".
}
\description{
Builds a multi-generation network starting from a seed gene using curated interactions
and correlation filtering across generations.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
obj <- BuildNetwork(obj, Gene = "PYGO2", Generation = 3, CorrelationThreshold = c(0.7,0.7,0.7))
}
