\title{Extract network-derived expression features}
\usage{
ExtractFeature(ExpCellNetObj)
}
\arguments{
\item{ExpCellNetObj}{An ExpressionCellNet object containing a normalized count
matrix and a constructed network.}
}
\value{
A data.frame or matrix of network-derived expression features
(genes × samples), suitable for regression or multivariate analysis.
}
\description{
Extracts a feature matrix from the normalized expression data by restricting
genes to those present in the constructed interaction network. The resulting
matrix is intended for downstream modeling and dimensionality reduction.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
features <- ExtractFeature(obj)
}
